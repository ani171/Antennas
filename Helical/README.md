# Helical Antenna
* One of the techniques to reduce the physical size of a wire antenna is to wind it over an imaginary cylinder, this structure is called a helix
* Geometrically, a helix consists of N turns of diameter D with spacing S between each turn. Let C = πD be the circumference of the cylindrical surface over which the helix is wound.
* The unwrapped length L, of one turn of the helix is given by L = √S2 + C2 <br>
* The pitch angle, α, which is the angle between the tangent to the helix and the plane perpendicular to the axis of the helix.

* If α = 0◦, the helix reduces to a loop of N turns and for α = 90◦, the helix is the same as a straight wire of length NL.

* A helical antenna has several modes of operation two of the popular ones are
    1. Axial mode
    2. Normal mode

### Axial mode of antenna
* In the axial mode of operation, a helical antenna radiates maximum energy along its axis. The radiation pattern has one major lobe and several minor lobes <br>
* The axial mode of operation is achieved by choosing the circumference of the helix to be around a wavelength and the spacing between the turns S = λ/4.
* The pitch angle, α, of the helical antenna operating in the axial mode is usually between 12◦ and 15◦

### Normal mode of antenna
* A helical antenna operates in the normal mode if its dimensions are small compared to the wavelength, that is D  λ and NL < λ.
* The radiation of a helical antenna operating in the normal mode is minimum along the axis of the helix and is maximum in a plane normal to the axis
* It is observed that if we choose C = √2Sλ the helical antenna radiates circularly polarized waves
