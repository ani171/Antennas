# Micro-strip patch antenna
* A microstrip patch antenna consists of a thin metallic patch above a large metallic ground plane. The patch is supported by a dielectric sheet, known as a substrate, the thickness of which is in the range of 0.005λ to 0.05λ. The patch is usually etched on the dielectric substrate using printed circuit board technology. Therefore, a microstrip patch antenna is also referred to as a printed antenna. The patch can be of any shape, e.g., square, circle, rectangle, triangle, etc. The performance of the patch depends on its size and shape.

* Consider a rectangular patch of length L and width W printed on a dielectric substrate of height h. The length of the patch is chosen to be around λg/2, where λg is the guide wavelength of the microstrip line of width W printed on the same dielectric substrate. With this choice of length, the electric field along the x-direction undergoes a 180◦ phase reversal from one edge to the other. It can be shown that the fields near edges 1 and 2 constructively add up producing the radiation with a maximum along the z-direction. Hence, edges 1 and 2 are known as the radiating edges. Further, it has been shown that the fields near edges 3 and 4 do not contribute to the radiation
